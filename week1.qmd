------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [**Defining Health**]{style="color: teal;"}

-   Most of us know when we are **healthy** and when we are not.

-   **Definition:** "*state of complete physical, mental and social well-being and not merely the absence of disease or infirmity*" (WHO)

-   To be healthy is a resource for everyday life.

-   You don't live to be healthy!

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [**What is public health?**]{style="color: teal;"}

-   **Definition:** Array of programs and services organized primarily (but not exclusively) by various levels of governments to
    -   [**protect**]{style="color: purple;"}
    -   [**promote**]{style="color: purple;"}
    -   [**restore**]{style="color: purple;"} the health of citizens.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [**What is population health?**]{style="color: teal;"}

-   **Definition:** The health outcomes of a group of individuals, including the distribution of those outcomes within the group.
-   Focus on:
    -   Improving health outcomes for populations rather than individuals.
    -   Interventions at multiple levels: individual, community, and systemic.
    -   Addressing disparities in health.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [**Determinants of health**]{style="color: teal;"}

1.  **Biological Factors:** Genetics, age, sex.
2.  **Behavioral Factors:** Lifestyle choices such as diet, physical activity, and smoking.
3.  **Social Environment:** Income, education, social support.
4.  **Physical Environment:** Housing, sanitation, air and water quality.
5.  **Healthcare Access:** Availability, affordability, and quality of care.

## [**How to MEASURE population health**]{style="color: teal;"}

### [Metrics and Measures]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Mortality Rates:**
    -   Life expectancy
        -   worlwide \[[WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/indicators/indicator-details/GHO/life-expectancy-at-birth-(years))\]
        -   usa \[[IHME](https://vizhub.healthdata.org/subnational/usa)\]
    -   Infant mortality \[[CDC](https://www.cdc.gov/nchs/pressroom/sosmap/infant_mortality_rates/infant_mortality.htm)\]
-   **Morbidity Rates:** Prevalence and incidence of diseases
    -   \[[WHO](https://www.who.int/data/gho/data/themes/mortality-and-global-health-estimates)\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Metrics and Measures]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Composite Metrics:**
    -   Disability-adjusted life years (**DALYs**). ![](week1_files/imgs/DALYs.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="80%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Metrics and Measures]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Composite Metrics:**
    -   DALYs measure the total burden ofdisease -- both from years of life lost due to premature death and years lived with a disability.
    -   One DALY equals one lost year of healthy life.
    -   DALY's geographical variation, worldwide \[[DALY-world](https://ourworldindata.org/burden-of-disease)\]

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Metrics and Measures]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Composite Metrics:**
    -   Quality-adjusted life years (**QALYs**).

        ![](week1_files/imgs/QALY.png){fig-align="left" width="40%"}

        -   Assess the value of medical interventions.
        -   One QALY equates to one year in perfect health

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [**Health disparities**]{style="color: teal;"}

### [Understanding inequities]{style="color: pink;"}

Variations in health outcomes by:

-   Socioeconomic status.
-   Race/ethnicity.
-   Geography.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Understanding inequities]{style="color: pink;"}

-   Example: Differences in life expectancy between urban and rural populations.

![](week1_files/imgs/differenceUrbanRuralLifeExpectancy.jpg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

-   Addressing disparities to achieve health equity.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Understanding inequities]{style="color: pink;"}

-   So why do we observe lower life expectancy in rural areas? ![](week1_files/imgs/mentimeter_qr_code.png){fig-align="center" width="30%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [**Interventions in population health**]{style="color: teal;"}

### [Levels of intervention]{style="color: pink;"}

1.  **Upstream:** Addressing root causes, such as policies and systemic changes.
2.  **Midstream:** Modifying behaviors and environments.
3.  **Downstream:** Providing healthcare services and individual interventions.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [**Case studies #1**]{style="color: teal;"}

### [Scurvy Among Sailors]{style="color: pink;"}

![](week1_files/imgs/scurvy.jpeg){fig-align="center" width="50%"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Upstreams intervention]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Addressing root causes**:
    -   Identifying the dietary deficiencies (lack of vitamin C) as the fundamental cause of scurvy.
    -   Enacting policies that mandated the inclusion of citrus fruits like lemons and limes in sailors' rations (e.g., British Navy's adoption of lemon juice in the 18th century).

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Midstreams intervention]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Modifying behaviors and environments**:

    -   Educating ship captains and sailors about the importance of fresh fruit and vegetables in preventing scurvy.
    -   Creating onboard systems to store and distribute citrus fruits to ensure consistent consumption.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Downstreams intervention]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Providing healthcare services and individual interventions**:
    -   Administering citrus fruits or vitamin C to sailors who were already showing symptoms of scurvy.
    -   Treating symptoms of scurvy directly (e.g., wound care, hydration) to mitigate immediate health risks.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Summary]{style="color: pink;"}

-   The case study of scurvy exemplifies how upstream, midstream, and downstream interventions collectively address population health challenges:
    -   **Upstream** policies ensure systemic changes (e.g., mandated citrus provisioning).

    -   **Midstream** efforts focus on creating supportive environments and promoting healthy behaviors.

    -   **Downstream** actions treat individual cases, alleviating acute suffering and mortality.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

## [**Case Studies #2**]{style="color: teal;"}

### [John Snow and Cholera]{style="color: blue;"}

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Upstream Intervention]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Addressing root causes**:
    -   Investigated the cholera outbreaks in London and identified **contaminated water** as the **primary source of transmission**.
    -   Advocated for systemic changes to the water and sewage systems, emphasizing the importance of **clean drinking water**.
    -   Collaborated with policymakers to promote sanitary reforms, leading to infrastructure improvements.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Midstream Intervention]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Modifying behaviors and environments**:
    -   **Educated** the **public** about the **risks of contaminated water** and the importance of using clean water sources.
    -   Marked contaminated water pumps, such as the infamous [Broad Street pump]{style="color: red;"}, to prevent further usage.
    -   Distributed educational materials to raise awareness about disease prevention and hygiene practices.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Downstream Intervention]{style="color: pink;"}

-   **Providing healthcare services and individual interventions**:
    -   Encouraged immediate medical attention for cholera victims, focusing on hydration and supportive care.
    -   Promoted boiling water as a short-term individual intervention to reduce the risk of consuming contaminated water.
    -   Worked with communities to treat cholera cases and manage local outbreaks effectively.

------------------------------------------------------------------------

### [Summary]{style="color: pink;"}

-   The John Snow cholera case highlights the importance of a multi-level approach to public health challenges:
    -   **Upstream** interventions address systemic issues, such as contaminated water supplies.
    -   **Midstream** efforts focus on behavior change and creating safer environments, like closing the Broad Street pump.
    -   **Downstream** actions provide immediate relief and treatment to affected individuals, reducing mortality during outbreaks.
